In GEOG435: Industrialization and Urbanization of China, a class I am taking, I was assigned to watch this documentary and take notes on some key points in it. 
<br>
<br>

Some of the people discussed in the documentary include:
- Robert Owen
- Frederick Engels
- Karl Marx
- Eduard Bernstein
- Vladimir Lenin
- Joseph Stalin
- Mao Zedong




## Robert Owen's socialism experiment
Robert Owen was a founding socialist who purchased a town in Indiana, and founded an experimental community called New Harmony. Then he went to congress to present his idea. He then welcomed 800 people to come live in  new harmony and participate in carrying out his idea. The people that were attracted to come live there were progressive intellectuals. In new harmony, there was free Education for all ages, advocation for women’s equal rights, and emphasis on scientific research. Through doing these things is how he believed he could mold the character of the people in the society from birth and create a perfect society. One of the main points was to get rid of Private property. This was the basis for eliminating Individual wealth, one of the main parts of socialism. It ended up being very inefficient and in the end dissolved. But it planted the major socialist ideas into the world.

##  Marx's most significant work
Marx's most famous work is the [Communist Manifesto](https://archive.org/details/manifestoofcommu00marx_1/page/n9/mode/2up). He said that Class struggle is the largest Issue in society. The idea that Capitalism as a system was exploitative of the workers in society while the working class was creating the things that made the Capitalists profit, but were still very poor. He said that because of this, as capitalism progresses more and more, the working class would become so desperate to the point that they would inevitably start a revolution. The result of the revolution would be a Socialist state where workers  would run society collectively without being owned or controlled.


## Major difference between Lenin and Bernstein's view of socialism
They both believed that the working class was not going to end up having revolution to reach the final goal of socialism. However Lenin believed that since the workers were not going to do the revolution on their own, it required a party to spark the revolution. His idea was to forcefully lead people to a revolution with the use of power and control. Essentially Lenin was more radical and wanted to overthrow the system entirely while Bernstein promoted democratic reform.

**Another Interesting Note:** After world war 1 when americanism overpowered socialism, the socialist party faded from the US political scene. Then the farmers who embraced the ideas of socialism moved north to Canada’s prairie region, bringing with them their ideas and then being the root of the socialist influence on canada. Essentially, socialism in Canada is an American import, something that most people do not Realize. Led to the CCF party which gained power first in Saskatchewan. They brought the socialist medicine scheme that was adopted by the government of canada.
